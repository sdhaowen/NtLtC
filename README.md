# Never too Late to Code

Coding has little to do with operating or programming a computer. It is more about information processing.

編碼其實和操作計算機和計算機編程關係不大。編碼更主要的是信息處理。

There are no homework assignments or tests in this group. It is mainly to teach you tools and help you open your mind.

本群沒有作業，也不考試。主要是教大家使用工具和幫助大家開眼界。

But if you do not do anything, you do not learn anything. You are wasting your own time.

但是如果你只是打醬油，什麼都學不會。浪費的是你自己的時間。
